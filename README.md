# Byte-Me-Food-App
"Byte Me!" is a CLI-based food ordering system designed for college canteens, enabling students to browse menus, place orders, and track deliveries from their hostel rooms. The system also allows canteen staff to manage menu items and process orders efficiently, while maintaining order histories for easy access.
